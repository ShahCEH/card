types of xpath 

ABSOLUTE

starts with a '/' , not frequently used 

how to use this absolute xpath

use the "ctrl + f " after inspecting an element. this ll take you to the specific block of code where the element is there.

absolute xpath ll start from the start of the DOM code 

example :


/html/body/div/div/div/div/div

follows the code using the dropdowns only and not jumping to anything specific
...........................



Relative XPATH

starts with "//" 
this have five syntax 

//tagname[@attribute name = 'attribute value'] => this is the basic syntax
//tagname[text()='fulltext']
//tagname[contains(@attribute name, 'attribute value')]
//tagname[contains(text(), 'partial text')] 
(//tagname[contains(@attributename, 'attribute value')])[index]

...........................

DYNAMIC XPATH

parent 
child
ancestors
decendants
preceding-sibling   -> elder
following-sibling   -> younger






need to find the ancestor or a parent of the particular web element we are supposed to locate and then go from there using parent clild or ancestor concept.




if need to select ID for xpath, use # symbol
